# Emoji to Icon Conversion Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to replace emoji icons with Lucide React vector icons throughout the Voilà Vélo Fruité website.

## Components Created

1. **NoStrawsIcon Component** (`/components/icons/no-straws-icon.tsx`)
   - Custom component that combines the `Ban` and `Coffee` icons to create a "No Straws" icon
   - Used in the Sustainability Section

2. **IconMapper Component** (`/components/ui/icon-mapper.tsx`)
   - Central component that maps icon names to Lucide React components
   - Provides consistent styling and a single point of maintenance for all icons
   - Currently includes 18 different icons used across the site

## Files Updated

1. **Sustainability Section** (`/components/sustainability-section.tsx`)
   - Replaced 5 emojis with Lucide icons:
     - 🚫🥤 → Custom NoStrawsIcon
     - ♻️ → Recycle
     - 🍎 → Apple
     - 🤝 → HandsClapping
     - 🌱 → Sprout

2. **Benefits Section** (`/components/benefits-section.tsx`)
   - Replaced 7 emojis with Lucide icons:
     - 💪 → Dumbbell
     - 🤝 → Users
     - 🏢 → Building2
     - 🛍️ → ShoppingBag

## Data Structure Changes

All components were updated to use an `iconName` property instead of the `icon` property, changing the data structure from:

```tsx
const data = [
  {
    icon: "🚫🥤",
    title: "Example Title",
    // ...
  }
]
```

To:

```tsx
const data = [
  {
    iconName: "noStraws",
    title: "Example Title",
    // ...
  }
]
```

## Rendering Changes

The rendering of icons was updated from directly displaying the emoji:

```tsx
<div className="icon-container">{item.icon}</div>
```

To using the IconMapper component:

```tsx
<div className="icon-container">
  <IconMapper iconName={item.iconName} className="h-10 w-10 mx-auto text-primary-red" />
</div>
```

## Benefits of the Change

1. **Consistency**: All icons now have a consistent style and size across the site
2. **Accessibility**: Vector icons are more accessible than emojis, which can vary in appearance across devices
3. **Customization**: Icons can be easily styled with different colors, sizes, and effects
4. **Performance**: Vector icons are lightweight and scale well on different screen sizes
5. **Maintainability**: Centralizing icon management in the IconMapper makes future updates easier

## Future Improvements

1. **Add more custom icons** for specialized cases (similar to the NoStrawsIcon)
2. **Implement animation** for icons in key sections to increase engagement
3. **Add color variants** for different sections/contexts
4. **Create icon size presets** (sm, md, lg) for consistent sizing across the site
